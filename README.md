Learning python by a noob coder

This repo must include codes from versatile sectors using python :
 1. Engineering python ( uses of numpy , sympy , matplotlib )
  for purpose like : ODE , calculus , plot graph 2d-3d  etc
  
 2. ROS python (used for Robot Operating System in Linux and ROS melodic)
 
 3. python for geogebra scripting 
 
 Things I personally don't like doing in python :
 1. use for web frame work (Django , flask )
 2. python as OOP (sucks man !! )
