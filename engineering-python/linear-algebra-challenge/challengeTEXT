In this exercise, you will fit a wave by finding the unknown parameters of the equation

y=a sin(πt)+b sin(2πt)+c sin(3πt)+d sin(4πt)

using the four data below :
(t0,y0)=(0.25,3)
.
.
.

Problem statement #
By substituting the values given above, form a system of four linear 
equations and solve for the unknown parameters: a, b, ca,b,c and dd

Create a plot of the wave for tt going from 00 to 11. Show the four
 measurements given above with dots. Add legends to your graphs as well.
